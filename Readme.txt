This was an old project form the "computer graphics" course back at the university.
It consisted in creating a lego-like board with some blocs and apply the openGL basics like lights, bounding boxes, collisions, materials, shadows, perspective and panoramic view, zoom, etc. 

The version here is a compiled version (easier to try). It was build using qt4 and c++ under Suse linux.
 
If you want to build the source:

- go to EsqueletVIG folder then excecute the script with the command " ./rmkf.sh "
- execute " qmake "
- execute " make "

It will build an executable called " PracticaVIG" in the /EsqueletVIG/app folder.


To execute, please run " ./PracticaVIG " in the /EsqueletVIG/app folder.

There are screenshots in the /screenshots folder.
